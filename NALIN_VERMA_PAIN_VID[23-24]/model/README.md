The above file contains the code to extract images from 2 videos i.e 23 and 24 from pain folder(one by one).

My approaches are based on- to extract images one by one and at the same time converting them into Grayscale images and storing them in a specific folder.

Extracted 50 frames each from both the videos at once using python opencv and os modules.
Converted the image into grayscale using cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY . Used os.path to store the images in specific directory.
