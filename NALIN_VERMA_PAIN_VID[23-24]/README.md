GOAL

To extract a total of 100 images i.e. 50 colored and 50 grayscale images from vid[23-24] and classify them into 4 folders(no_pain , mild_pain, moderate_pain, severe_pain), based on the facial expression of the newborn.


PURPOSE

My purpose was not only to achieve the mentioned goal, but also to learn along . Since i have no prior knowledge of OpenCV , i have watched tutorials on using OpenCV and how to extract images and then implemented it in my code, then further worked on my code to make it better i.e to write code for extracting RGB images and converting them into Grayscale images simultaneously , instead of writing 2 seperate codes.

DESCRIPTION

I had watched several videos on How to extract images using openCV,  and then implemented it in my code, to extract 50 images of both the types( colored as well as grayscale) for all 2 videos that I was assigned with.


WHAT I HAD DONE

First, you can refer my code files in Model folder to understand the code I have used(which is commented to make it easy to understand), then to see the Outcome of my approach, refer to Image_Datasets folder and you can see the Colored and Grayscale images in different respective folders. My approach was to simply learn about how to use cv2 and other libraries for extracting image frames and then work on it.


WORKFLOW OF YOUR PROJECT FILES

Refer to compilation steps below, and go through the code. The final Image Datasets folder has images classified into folders based on Facial Expressions. My workflow has been - Learn, Code, Extract and convert those to grayscale, Save images , and finally classify the images into different folders.

STATE YOUR PROCEDURE AND UNDERSTANDING FROM YOUR WORK

I have no prior knowledge of OpenCv ,so i got a chance to learn new things , and on the other side, I have gone through some blogs and video tutorials for a better approach.


DETAILED EXPLANATION OF SCRIPT, IF APPLICABLE

My code files are added with comments to undrstand my approach.


LIBRARIES NEEDED

cv2
os


COMPILATION STEPS

Import Libraries

Read the video files from the folder they are saved in
Extract image frames for each video
Save them in a folder
convert these frames to grayscale
Save them in a folder.


RESEARCH

Watched tutorials and read blogs on how to use OpenCv and extract images using OpenCV


SCREENSHOTS

Here are the sample of output from each category:

CONCLUSION

The conclusion is that after implementing into my Code and then, classifying Images, the Dataset is ready to used with a model to save lives of many newborn babies which are at a very high-risk.
